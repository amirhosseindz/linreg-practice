# linreg-practice
Goal: build an end-to-end pipeline that predicts house prices using the California Housing dataset (sklearn). Youâ€™ll practice data loading, EDA, feature engineering, modeling with LinearRegression, diagnostics, regularization (Ridge/Lasso), cross-validation, saving the model, and a tiny deployment example.
